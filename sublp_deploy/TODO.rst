Remove: Relative to full sublp
--------------------------------
Goal: single file (seperate version) of sublp, which is less complex.
So some developers will be more likely to use it.

- ValueMeta and things using it.
- Specialized errors
- Place cases in file with dispatcher
- Maybe: remove interfaces
- REmove py3 version specific code
