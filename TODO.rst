Code Refactoring
-----------------
- Change configuration file to being a JSON file (sublprc.json), and add configuration reader function
- Create a version (sublp_dist) which combines everything in one file.

- Add new final case: creates a project + workspace file and opens it.

Project Support
------------------
- Prepare setup.py - along with requirements.txt (pip freeze?)
    - Test installation into virtualenv
    - Write in installation steps in README.rst, esp. .bash_profile
- Fill in README
    - Examples of use
    - Purpose (as if speaking to office mate)
    - Installation
    - Windows compatible?
    - Note on Python2/3 compatibility
- Ask for help testing (Jason?)
