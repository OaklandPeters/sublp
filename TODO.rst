Code Refactoring
-----------------
- Allow sublp to passthrough other arguments. EG 'sublp {name} path' should be equivalent to sublime --project=name path.
- Change configuration file to being a JSON file (sublprc.json), and add configuration reader function
- Create a version (sublp_dist) which combines everything in one file.


Project Support
------------------
- requirements.txt (pip freeze?)
- Test installation into virtualenv
    - Walk through installation process esp .bash_profile
- Fill in README
    - Examples of use
    - Purpose (as if speaking to office mate)
    - Windows compatible?
    - Note on Python2/3 compatibility
- Ask for help testing (Jason?)
